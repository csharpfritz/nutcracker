## BEFORE YOU LEAVE HOME

✅ Measure nutcracker base holes (are they 4mm or larger?)
✅ Check if you already have small screws at home
✅ Bring calipers or ruler if you have one
✅ Take this list on your phone

## AT HOME DEPOT - WHAT TO ASK

**Go to customer service or hardware associate:**

> "I need M4 metric screws, about 12mm long, for a Christmas project. 
> If you don't have metric, #8 wood screws in ½ inch will work. 
> I need about 8-12 screws."

They'll point you right to them!

## ASSEMBLY TONIGHT

Once you have screws:

1. **Wait for prints to finish** (~12:30 AM)
2. **Let parts cool** (5-10 minutes)
3. **Test fit** everything before screwing
4. **Assemble Christmas morning** (takes 15-20 minutes)

---

## BACKUP PLAN (NO SCREWS AVAILABLE)

If you can't find screws tonight:

**Temporary Mounting:**
1. **Hot glue gun** - Quick and removable
2. **Zip ties** through holes - Works surprisingly well
3. **Velcro tape** - Strong mounting, removable
4. **Double-sided tape** - For lighter parts
5. **Rubber bands** - Last resort

**You WILL get it working for Christmas morning!**

✅ Are they long enough? (12mm / ½" minimum)
✅ Do I need washers? (Nice to have, not critical)
✅ Do I have a screwdriver at home? (If not, get one)
